# TODO

New here? Read `AGENTS.md` first (conventions). Key ones: one task = one commit;
commit messages are ONE short line (no body, no Claude co-author trailer); never
run the app — verify via `cargo check` / `npm run build`, the user runs it; pin
all vendored deps. **Remove a task line the moment it's done.** Tasks are grouped
by phase; within a phase they're ordered highest-priority first.

State of the world: the editor is feature-complete for now (CodeMirror + Tidal
eval, transport, `_pianoroll`/`_scope` visuals, `arrange`, sound browser with
synths, VS Code keybindings, settings modal). `cargo tauri build` produces a
runnable macOS `Selene.app` (~3.2 GB, vendor/backend/core bundled) that plays
synths + samples on the build machine (samples via a repo fallback). Release
logs: `~/Library/Logs/app.selene/`. Rebuilding needs the old bundle cleared
first: `chflags -R nouchg target/release/bundle 2>/dev/null; rm -rf target/release/bundle`.

## Phase 5 — Bundle (macOS only for now)

macOS-first: ship a working macOS installer before touching other platforms.
Windows and Linux come later (see Backlog).

- [ ] Distribution strategy decision (gates the GHC work below): fat ~3.2 GB bundle vs thin installer + first-run fetch. Likely hybrid — bundle the small relocation-sensitive bits (SuperCollider, quarks, sc3-plugins ≈ 700 MB), fetch the big/licensed bits on first run (samples; maybe GHC via a managed install to sidestep relocation).
- [ ] GHC relocation (only if GHC stays bundled): absolute paths are baked in — needs a ghci wrapper passing `-B` + a relocated package db, AND Tidal itself moved into the bundle (it currently lives in `~/.cabal/store`, referenced by absolute path in `vendor/tidal-ghc-env`). See the GHC-relocation memory note. Without this the bundle only runs on the build machine.
- [ ] CI: `.github/workflows/` build + package on macOS.
- [ ] Smoke-test the installer on a clean macOS VM before any release tag (proves relocation/fetch actually work off the build machine).
- [ ] Import-sample button: open a file/folder picker and copy the chosen samples into an internal, git-ignored samples folder under a category (a new bank folder). Reload SuperDirt's `loadSoundFiles` so they show up in the sound browser. Add the internal folder to `.gitignore`.

## Bugs

- [ ] Step highlighting mis-tracks pitched patterns. Eval `note "0 4 7" # s
  "sawtooth"` (audio is correct, arpeggiates 0-4-7): the editor's step
  highlighter lights `0`, `4`, then `4` again instead of `0 4 7` — looks like an
  off-by-one / wrong source-position mapping on the last step. Lives in the
  `tidal-event` OSC stream → editor highlight path (`osc.rs` tap + `main.ts`),
  not in the synths. Check whether it also mistracks plain `s "bd sn hh"`.

## Default program (Strudel demo port)

Make the default editor SEED a Selene port of this Strudel demo. Source block
(Strudel syntax — NO sliders, `slider(x,…)` → `x`):
```
$kick: s("sbd!4")._scope().duck("2:3:4").duckattack(.2).duckdepth(.8)
$bass: n(irand(10).sub(7).seg(16)).scale("c:minor").rib(46,1)
  .distort("2.2:.3").s("sawtooth").lpf(200).lpenv(3.376).lpq(12).orbit(2)._pianoroll()
$saw: s("supersaw").detune(1).rel(6).beat(2, 32).slow(2).orbit(2).fm("2").fmh(1.04)
$rising: s("pulse").orbit(4).seg(16).dec(.1).fm(time).fmh(time).lpf(500).lpenv(3.008)
```

Already landed (commits `c0bc47b`, `655723c`): the `sawtooth`/`pulse`/`supersaw`
synths exist, and Selene's `duck` is defined in `core/BootTidal.hs`:
`duck n depth attack pat` — pumps `pat`'s gain `n`×/cycle (see README). It is a
self-duck (applied to the ducked layer, e.g. the bass), NOT the cross-orbit form
Strudel's `duck` on the kick implies — port accordingly.

Remaining, in order (each step its own commit; verify audibly with the user, who
runs the app — never run it yourself, see AGENTS.md):

- [ ] Map the remaining Strudel params/functions to Tidal 1.9.4, confirming each
  exists before use (query in ghci: `vendor/ghc/bin/ghci -package-env
  vendor/tidal-ghc-env`, then `:t <name>` / `queryArc <pat> (Arc 0 1)`):
  `.sub`→`|-`, `.seg`→`segment`, `.rib`→`zoom`/loop window, `.scale`, `irand`,
  `distort`, `detune`, `fm`/`fmh`, `dec`/`rel`, `beat`, `lpf`/`lpq`, and
  `lpenv`→a filter-envelope control. Add a Selene helper in `core/BootTidal.hs`
  for any gap (document it in README's "Selene-specific functions" table, same
  commit — AGENTS.md rule).
- [ ] Write the ported patterns as `d1..d4` blocks (blank-line separated so each
  evals independently) using `_scope`/`_pianoroll` as in the source, and confirm
  the whole thing plays end-to-end with the user.
- [ ] Replace the editor SEED string in `editor/src/main.ts` (the `SEED`
  const, ~line 1461) with the ported track. Verify `npm run build` in `editor/`.

## Phase 6 — Recording (deferred)

- [ ] OSC session logger in `core/` — capture/replay via the existing OSC seam.
- [ ] WAV export: with the cursor on an `arrange` block, a Render button (or Cmd-R) bounces the track to WAV — reset the cycle clock, play for the arrangement's duration, capture scsynth's output via its recording OSC API (`/b_alloc`, `/b_read`, `/b_write` or the `Record` quark). No separate DAW.

## Backlog (optional / unscheduled)

- [ ] `ur`-style named-section arranger, if the `arrange` tuple form proves clunky for longer tracks.
- [ ] Windows bundle: package the sidecars + resolve resource paths; add to CI; smoke-test on a clean VM.
- [ ] Linux bundle: same.
- [ ] Hide the sclang Dock icon (cosmetic; parked). Findings: sclang is a Qt cocoa app, so it shows a Dock icon. Clean routes are blocked — the vendored Qt has no `offscreen`/`minimal` platform plugin (so `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` fails), and `LSUIElement` on SuperCollider.app's Info.plist can't be written (macOS App Management protects the signed bundle; the user doesn't want SC.app modified anyway). Viable path: a thin "agent" `.app` we own (our Info.plist with `LSUIElement`, a copied `sclang` binary, symlinks to SC's Frameworks/Resources/PlugIns) launched instead of SC.app — fiddly, needs on-device iteration.

## Conventions (reference, not tasks)

- **Visuals** are opt-in and `_`-prefixed (Strudel-style). Each is defined as `id`
  in `core/BootTidal.hs` (pure passthrough, no audio effect); the editor detects
  the marker on an evaluated `dN` block and renders a per-channel canvas in the
  viz panel, fed by the `tidal-event` / `scope-frame` OSC streams. Plain Canvas
  2D, zero-dep — do NOT use `@strudel/draw` (AGPL-3, and it needs a JS Pattern
  object we don't have since Tidal runs in Haskell).
- **Selene-specific functions** (anything not stock Tidal) must be documented in
  the README's "Selene-specific functions" section when added.
